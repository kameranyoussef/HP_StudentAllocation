# Honours Project Student Allocation System

The Honours Project Allocation System is a web-based platform that enables third and fourth year students to browse, select and apply for honours project topics in various disciplines. The platform also facilitates communication between students and potential supervisors, who can provide feedback and guidance on the project proposals. The platform has three types of users (Students, Supervisors, Admin) who can access different features and functionalities of the application with a custom login system for each user type. For example, students can view and filter available topics, submit their preferences and proposals, and track their application status. Supervisors can create and edit topics, review and rank applications, and approve or reject proposals. Admin can manage the overall project allocation process, assign topics to supervisors, and monitor the progress of the applications. The platform was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP - CodeIgniter Framework, and MySQL. It is responsive and compatible with different devices and browsers. The platform aims to streamline the project allocation process for students and supervisors, and to provide a user-friendly and secure interface for honours projects.
